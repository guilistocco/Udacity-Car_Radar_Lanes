## Why this is an important project?
As an engineer student, I saw the oportunity to use data science in a traffic context. The porpuse of this project is to reflect about a few assumptions every one that uses public or private transportation wonder: Does cars on the left lane run faster? Does heavy vehicles alwyas stay on right lanes? How can we predict the speed of new cars? Those questions were answered using data science skills


## About the archives
This repository works with data from radars all over São Paulo

* Radar_Data_2.03.2018.csv contains all vehicles that radars could capture on the 2nd of March, 2018. Data is avaliable at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VG-t8t1mq_HZV-Ue6zkth_3Ne4IfCOrq/view?usp=sharing . Some of the columns are speed (in dm/s, must be converted), length (in dm, must be converted), date of capture, type of vehicle, etc.
* Lanes_type.xlsx tells the use of each lane
* The .png files are images used on the medium post about the project
* enviroment.yml contains the version of python and libraries used on this project. The purpose of this file is to allow the code to be reproducible
* LICENCE indicates the MIT license for this project
* Radar_analysis.ipynb is the jupyter notebook used to take coclusions for this project
